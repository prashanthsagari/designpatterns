OO Principle:
************
6. Design Principle: Depend upon abstractions. Do not depend upon concrete classes

OO Pattern:
***********
Factory Method Pattern: defines an interface for creating an object, but lets sub-classes decide which class to instantiate. Factory method lets a class defer instantiation to subclasses.

Abstract Factory Pattern: provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes
