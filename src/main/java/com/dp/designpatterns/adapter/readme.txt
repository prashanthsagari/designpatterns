OO Principle:

Design Principle: Principle of Least Knowledge: talk only to your immediate friends.

OO Pattern:
**********
Adapter Pattern: converts the interface of a class into another interface the clients expect. Adapter lets classes work together that 
couldn't otherwise because of incompatible interfaces.

Facade Pattern: provides a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem. Facade defines a higher-level interface that makes the
the subsystem easier to use.

Adapter  --> converts one interface to another
Decorator  --> doesn't alter the interface, but adds responsibility
Facade  --> Makes an interface simpler
