OO Principle:
*************
Don't call us, we'll call you


OO Pattern:
************
Template Method Pattern: defines the skeleton of an algorithm in a method, deferring some steps to subclasses. Template Method lets subclasses
redefine  certain steps of an algorithm without changing the algorithm's structure.


Template  Method: Subclasses decide how to implement steps in an algorithm.
Strategy: Encapsulate interchangeable behaviors and use delegation to decide which behavior to use.
Factory method: Subclasses decide which concrete classes to instantiate.
